hey bro
i am working on a react ts + tailwind and django drf project which is an online supermarket management system and/or POS system.
which is multitenant.

and now i am thinking of making a settings page.
which would contain settings like shop name, phone, email, address
email configuration like smtp_host and others you know.
logo of shop, and others you think is needed.

so i want you to make one for me beautifully styled as state-of-the-art,
and apply light and dark theme such that if you wanna to give a component two color for two themes first define the color in tailwind like --color-sdfgd-settings: blue; with suffix settings and give it two color values in two themes like [data-theme='dark'] { --color-sdfgd-settings: blue; }
and use the color as like this bg-sdfgd-settings or text-sdfgd-settings
if you have any question ask
