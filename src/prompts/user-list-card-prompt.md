hey bro i need a list users
with these fields which is listed as i don't know maybe card or maybe table you know better and a button which when clicked go to the user profile the user profile is already made (just link it to like /users/1/profile)

and also a form to add new user.
in a react ts + tailwind project

properly typed components as ts wants

apply two theme light and dark

if you wanna give an element different colors in different modes
first define a color name for it as --color-sdfsdf: #eee;
and give it different color values in different modes
like.
.light {
  --color-dfgdsf: #eee;
}

.dark {
  --color-dfgdsf: #222;
}

and use it like this <div className="bg-dfgdsf">

just give me the colors and the their values in different modes, you do not have to make it work

also improve the styling or other parts as need be and you think is necessary.
if you have any question ask
